Minecraft.class line 1802 has mouse input handling. 

Usiing while mouse.next consumes all events so they have to be handled if only a subset of mouse
events are to be disabled. See the line above.

Player movement can be disabled in the same place by consuming dx and dy.

The keyboard is tricky too, some solutions:
    Change the movementInput variable in player. Downsides, only effects movement.
    
    Rebind keys to somewhere else. Downsides, can still be pressed by the player.
